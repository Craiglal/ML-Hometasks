    "# Logistic Regression from Scratch with NumPy\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to another post of implementing machine learning algorithms! Today, the algorithm that we will be implementing from scratch is **Logistic Regression**. Alongside its belowed sister algorithm linear regression, this one is higly used in machine learning as well, due to its simplicity and robustness. Even though its called logistic *regression*, it's actually a classification algorithm that is used to classify input data into its classes (labels).\n",
    "    \n",
    "This powerful machine learning model can be used to answer some questions such as;\n",
    "* Whether an e-mail is spam or not\n",
    "* If the customer will churn\n",
    "* Whether a tumor is benign or malignant\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the questions above are simply yes-no questions, therefore they can be used to classify input data into two classes. Hence, the term binary classification is used when the data can be categorized into two distinct classes. Obviously, multi-class classification deals with data that has more than two labels (classes). After grasping the ins and outs of logistic regression to make binary classification, transition to a multi-class classification is pretty straight-forward, as a consequence, here, we will deal with data that has two classes only.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Remember, that in linear regression we predict numerical values based on the input values and parameters of the model.Here, in logistic regression we can also approach the model as we are trying to predict numbers but this time these numbers correspond to the probability values of input data belonging to a particular class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term logistic in logistic regression is used because this time we are applying another function to the weighted sum of input data and paratemeters of the model and this function is  called logit (sigmoid) function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid function always outputs values between 0 and 1, and thus can be used to calculate probabilities of input data belonging to a certain class:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ sigmoid(x) =  1 / (1 + e^{-x})  $\n",
    "    \n",
    "Without further ado, let's start writing the code for this implementation. I will explain the code as I go, whenever deemed necessary. "
